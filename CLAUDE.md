## Project Structure

```
client/src/
  App.tsx              — Routes + auth gate (WelcomeGate, ClerkLoaded)
  pages/               — All page components
  components/          — Shared components (sidebar, modals, wizards)
  lib/
    queryClient.ts     — React Query client + apiRequest() helper
    clientContext.tsx   — ClientProvider + useClient() hook

server/
  index.ts             — Express app setup, DB migrations, scheduler bootstrap
  routes-oauth.ts      — ALL API endpoints (~26k lines, single file)
  storage.ts           — IStorage interface + DatabaseStorage (Drizzle queries)
  *-scheduler.ts       — Background jobs (GA4, LinkedIn, Meta, reports, KPIs)

shared/
  schema.ts            — ALL Drizzle table definitions + Zod types (single source of truth)
```

---

## Multi-Tenant Model

```
User (Clerk) → owns Clients → owns Campaigns → owns Connections/Metrics/Sources
```

- `clients` table: `ownerId` (Clerk user ID), `name`
- `campaigns` table: `clientId` (tenant isolation), `ownerId` (claimed on first access)
- `ClientProvider` context supplies `selectedClientId` (persisted to localStorage)
- `WelcomeGate` redirects to `/welcome` when no clients exist
- Sidebar shows client dropdown; navigation greyed out when no client selected

## Campaign Detail Tabs (`campaign-detail.tsx`)

The campaign detail page has these main sections/tabs:

1. **Overview** — Performance Summary grid (Spend, Revenue, ROAS, ROI, Conversions, CPA), KPI Health, Benchmark Health, Recommendations
2. **Connections** — Connected platform cards (GA4, LinkedIn, Meta, Google Ads), Revenue & Spend Sources with CRM cards (HubSpot, Salesforce, Shopify, Google Sheets, Manual, CSV)
3. **KPIs** — Campaign-level KPI definitions with targets, alerts, progress tracking
4. **Benchmarks** — Industry/competitor/historical benchmarks with variance tracking
5. **Reports** — Scheduled report configurations
6. **Attribution** — Attribution model dashboard (first/last touch, linear, time decay, position, data-driven)
7. **A/B Tests** — Test configuration with variants, traffic allocation, statistical significance

## Revenue & Spend Architecture

### Spend Flow
```
Source (CSV, Sheets, LinkedIn API, Meta API, Google Ads API, Manual)
  → spendSources (definition: sourceType, displayName, mappingConfig, isActive)
  → spendRecords (daily normalized rows: date, spend, currency, sourceType)
  → campaign.spend (denormalized total, recalculated by recalcCampaignSpend)
```

### Revenue Flow
```
Source (GA4 native, Manual, CSV, Sheets, HubSpot, Salesforce, Shopify)
  → revenueSources (definition)
  → revenueRecords (daily normalized rows: date, revenue, currency, platformContext)
```

### Platform Context
- `platformContext` field (`'ga4' | 'linkedin' | 'meta'`) prevents cross-platform revenue/spend leakage
- GA4 native revenue tracked separately from CRM-sourced revenue
- Campaign-level Total Revenue (in `outcome-totals`) = GA4 onsite + CRM offsite (additive)
- Platform-specific pages (GA4, LinkedIn, Meta) show only their own platform's revenue

### Financial Aggregation Endpoints
- `GET /api/campaigns/:id/spend-totals` / `spend-breakdown` / `spend-to-date` / `spend-daily?date=YYYY-MM-DD`
- `GET /api/campaigns/:id/revenue-totals` / `revenue-breakdown` / `revenue-to-date`
- `GET /api/campaigns/:id/outcome-totals` — unified metrics (GA4 + platforms + revenue + spend)
- `DELETE /api/campaigns/:id/spend-sources/:sourceId` — soft-delete a spend source, recalculate total

### Spend Mutation Endpoints
- `POST /api/campaigns/:id/spend/process/manual` — Manual, LinkedIn test, Meta test, Google Ads test. Accepts optional `sourceId` for edit/update.
- `POST /api/campaigns/:id/spend/csv/process` — CSV upload. Accepts optional `sourceId` in mapping JSON for edit/update.
- `POST /api/campaigns/:id/spend/sheets/process` — Google Sheets. Deduplicates by `connectionId` in mappingConfig (auto-detects existing source).
- `POST /api/campaigns/:id/spend/linkedin/process` — LinkedIn production mode (real API data).

### Revenue Cards
- **GA4 page** (`ga4-metrics.tsx`): `financialRevenue` = GA4 native revenue only (falls back to imported if no GA4 revenue metric). This is platform-specific — do NOT add CRM revenue here. No add/edit icons on the GA4 Total Revenue card.
- **Campaign Overview** (`campaign-detail.tsx`): Uses `outcome-totals` endpoint which returns unified cross-platform revenue (GA4 + CRM offsite sources). This is the right place for combined totals. Shows micro copy breakdown, "+" icon opens Add Revenue modal, edit icon opens existing source.

### Spend Cards (GA4 Overview)
- **Total Spend**: Uses `financialSpend` (prefers `spend-breakdown` total, falls back to `spend-to-date`). Shows "+" icon to add sources and per-source breakdown with edit/trash icons when sources exist. Shows "Add Spend" prompt when no spend exists.
- **Latest Day Revenue**: Uses `ga4ReportDate` to find the most recent **complete** day (skips today's partial intraday data). GA4-only — does not include CRM/imported revenue.
- **Latest Day Spend**: Queries `/spend-daily` for both today and yesterday, prefers whichever has data. Manual/CSV/ad platform spend records are dated today; scheduler records have actual historical dates. No dead fallback to GA4 `_raw.spend` (ga4_daily_metrics has no spend column).
- **Empty state gate**: Card shows populated view when `spendBreakdownResp.sources.length > 0 OR financialSpend > 0` (prevents showing $0 when breakdown hasn't loaded but spend exists).
- Per-source trash uses AlertDialog confirmation → `DELETE /api/campaigns/:id/spend-sources/:sourceId`.

### Spend Recalculation Rules (CRITICAL)
- **`recalcCampaignSpend(campaignId)`** in `routes-oauth.ts` is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for recalculating `campaign.spend`. ALL spend mutation endpoints MUST call it after changes.
- It sums `spend_records` via `getSpendBreakdownBySource` (uses today as end date, NOT yesterday) + `mappingConfig.amount` for sources without records.
- **Every spend source MUST create at least one `spend_record`** — even CSV/Sheets without a date column create a single record dated today. Without records, `spend-breakdown` returns $0 for that source and micro copy shows wrong amounts.
- **Never overwrite `campaign.spend` directly** — always call `recalcCampaignSpend` which sums ALL active sources.
- **Edit flows MUST pass `sourceId`** to update the existing source (not create a duplicate). The backend checks for `sourceId` in the request body and calls `updateSpendSource` + `deleteSpendRecordsBySource` before creating new records.
- **Delete endpoint** soft-deletes the source (`isActive = false`), then calls `recalcCampaignSpend` to update the total.

### GA4 Overview Data Scoping
- **Summary cards** (`ga4-to-date`): Campaign lifetime (startDate → yesterday), current campaign's `ga4CampaignFilter` only. This is the source of truth for total Sessions, Users, Conversions, Revenue.
- **Campaign Breakdown** (`ga4-breakdown`): Last 90 days (hardcoded `dateRange`), acquisition dimensions (source/medium/campaign). Drops "uninformative" rows where source/medium are `(not set)`, so its sum may be lower than Summary totals. Uses current campaign's filter only.
- **Landing Pages** (`ga4-landing-pages`): Campaign lifetime, top 50 rows. Uses current campaign's `ga4CampaignFilter` only (NOT cross-client).
- **Conversion Events** (`ga4-conversion-events`): Campaign lifetime, top 25 rows. Uses current campaign's `ga4CampaignFilter` only (NOT cross-client).
- **Users are non-additive**: Summing users across campaigns or sections over-counts due to user overlap. Landing Pages has a tooltip warning about this.
- **IMPORTANT**: All GA4 Overview endpoints MUST scope to the current campaign's `ga4CampaignFilter`. Never aggregate filters across all client campaigns — that would mix data from unrelated campaigns sharing the same GA4 property.

### KPI UI Pattern (shared across GA4 and LinkedIn)

**Summary cards** (5-column grid): Total KPIs | Above Target (>+5%) | On Track (±5%) | Below Track (<-5%) | Avg. Progress. Uses `classifyKpiBand()` from `shared/kpi-math.ts` with `NEAR_TARGET_BAND_PCT = 5`.

**Progress logic** (from `shared/kpi-math.ts`):
- `isLowerIsBetterKpi()` — detects CPC/CPM/CPA/CPL/Spend as "lower is better"
- `computeEffectiveDeltaPct()` — percent delta vs target (sign-flipped for lower-is-better)
- `classifyKpiBand()` — above/near/below using ±5% band
- `computeAttainmentPct()` — uncapped progress percentage (can exceed 100%)
- `computeAttainmentFillPct()` — capped 0-100% for progress bar fill
- Progress bar colors: green ≥100%, amber ≥90%, red <90%

**KPI card rendering**: Current/Target values in 2-col grid, progress bar with uncapped attainment %, delta text below ("X% above/below target"). No status label text — delta text replaces it. Alert indicators next to KPI name: yellow `AlertTriangle` icon (tooltip "Alerts enabled") when `alertsEnabled`, red pulsing dot (`animate-pulse` + `animate-ping`) when threshold actively breached (tooltip shows current/threshold/condition). Alert threshold input formats on blur (e.g. `500` → `500.00`).

**Create KPI modal layout** (LinkedIn is the reference pattern):
- Template/metric selection (platform-specific tiles or dropdown)
- Grid 2 cols: KPI Name | [empty]
- Full width: Description (Textarea with char counter)
- Grid 3 cols: Current Value | Target Value | Unit (free text input)
- Grid 2 cols: Priority (Low/Medium/High) | [empty]
- Alert Settings (border-t separator, no heading):
  - Checkbox: "Enable alerts for this KPI" + description text
  - [Conditional when enabled, indented `pl-6`]:
    - Grid 2 cols: Alert Threshold (free text decimal, "Value at which to trigger the alert") | Alert When (Below/Above/Equals)
    - Grid 2 cols: Alert Frequency (Immediate/Daily/Weekly) + helper text | Email checkbox + conditional email recipients
- DialogFooter: Cancel | Create/Update KPI

### GA4 KPIs Tab
- **Templates**: ROAS, ROI, CPA, Revenue, Conversions, Engagement Rate, Conversion Rate, Users, Sessions + Custom. Templates requiring spend/revenue are disabled when sources aren't connected.
- **Live values**: `getLiveKpiValue()` computes current values from live query data (NOT stored `currentValue`). Stored `currentValue` is only a fallback for custom/legacy KPIs.
- **Blocked KPIs**: KPIs missing required data (spend/revenue) show "Blocked" status with explanation link. Excluded from scoring.
- **No timeframe scaling**: `timeframe`, `trackingPeriod`, and `rollingAverage` fields were removed from the form. All KPIs evaluate on cumulative values. Targets are absolute goals.
- **ROAS unit**: GA4 ROAS is stored/displayed as percentage (300 = 3x). LinkedIn ROAS is stored as ratio (3.0). These are separate KPI systems on separate pages — no cross-platform display.
- **Scheduler**: `ga4-kpi-benchmark-jobs.ts` records daily `kpiProgress` rows. Uses `getSpendTotalForRange()` (NOT `campaign.spend`) for accurate financial KPIs.
- **Auth**: All KPI CRUD endpoints require `ensureCampaignAccess` or `ensureKpiAccess`. `test-alerts` endpoint requires authenticated user.
- **Cascade delete**: Deleting a KPI also deletes its `kpiProgress` and `kpiAlerts` rows.

## Add Spend Wizard (`AddSpendWizardModal.tsx`)

### Steps
`select` → source-specific step (`ad_platform`, `csv`, `csv_map`, `sheets_choose`, `sheets_map`, `manual`, `paste`)

### Source Types & Flows
| Source | sourceType stored | Processing function | Endpoint |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| LinkedIn (test) | `linkedin_api` | `processLinkedInSpend` | `/spend/process/manual` |
| LinkedIn (prod) | `linkedin_api` | `processLinkedInSpend` | `/spend/linkedin/process` |
| Meta (test) | `ad_platforms` | `importAdPlatformSpend` | `/spend/process/manual` |
| Google Ads (test) | `ad_platforms` | `importAdPlatformSpend` | `/spend/process/manual` |
| CSV | `csv` | `processCsv` | `/spend/csv/process` |
| Google Sheets | `google_sheets` | `processSheets` | `/spend/sheets/process` |
| Manual | `manual` | `processManual` | `/spend/process/manual` |

### Ad Platform Test Mode (LinkedIn, Meta, Google Ads)
- Test mode toggle → mock campaigns with name, spend, impressions, clicks
- Campaign selection table with checkboxes (select-all + individual)
- Import button shows selected total only
- Saves `mappingConfig.breakdown` with per-campaign data + `selectedCampaignIds`
- **Must exactly simulate production** — no extra UI elements (date pickers, config) that don't exist in real flow

### Edit Mode
- `isEditing = Boolean(props.initialSource?.id)` — detects edit mode from passed source
- Edit prefill `useEffect` routes to correct step and pre-populates state based on `sourceType`
- ALL processing functions pass `sourceId` when editing to update (not create duplicate)
- Cancel button closes modal when editing (doesn't go back to source selection)

### Input Formatting
- Manual spend input formats to 2 decimal places on blur (e.g. `500` → `500.00`) using `toLocaleString("en-US", { minimumFractionDigits: 2 })`

### Micro Copy Display (`ga4-metrics.tsx`)
- `spendDisplaySources` merges `spend-breakdown` (has per-source amounts from records) with `spend-sources` (definitions fallback)
- Each source line shows: `displayName` (e.g. "Meta Ads", "Google Ads", "Google Sheets") + formatted spend amount
- **displayName must be a clean platform label** — use "Google Sheets" (NOT the spreadsheet name), "Meta Ads", "Google Ads", "LinkedIn Ads", "CSV" etc.
- Edit icon (pencil) + trash icon per source, "+" button to add new sources

---

## Key Patterns

### Page Layout
Each page renders `<Navigation />` + `<Sidebar />` directly — there is no shared layout wrapper component.

### API Auth
Use `getActorId(req)` for Clerk user ID in route handlers.

### Campaign Ownership
`ownerId` field on campaigns; campaigns without it get claimed on first access via `ensureCampaignAccess()`.

### Query Keys
Include filter params (e.g., `dateRange`, `platformContext`, `clientId`) for correct cache invalidation.

### Cache Invalidation After Revenue/Spend Changes
```typescript
// Revenue mutations (AddRevenueWizardModal):
// Invalidates: outcome-totals, revenue-sources, revenue-to-date, revenue-totals, revenue-breakdown

// Spend mutations (add/edit/delete in ga4-metrics.tsx):
// Invalidates: spend-totals, spend-to-date, spend-sources, spend-breakdown, spend-daily
// Refetches: spend-to-date, spend-breakdown
```

### OAuth Flow (CRM Sources)
1. User clicks CRM card in Add Revenue modal
2. `handleCrmSourceClick` checks connection status
3. If not connected → opens OAuth popup window
4. OAuth callback stores tokens → popup closes
5. Wizard step loads (campaign field mapping → crosswalk → pipeline → revenue → review → save)

### HubSpot Pipeline (Proxy)
Available for all platform contexts. Lets users select a HubSpot deal stage (e.g., SQL) as an early pipeline signal for long sales cycles. Optional — default is Revenue-only.

### Disconnect CRM Sources
Trash icon + AlertDialog confirmation on CRM cards in Add Revenue modal. Deletes revenue source + OAuth connection. LinkedIn/Meta queries wrapped in try-catch to handle missing `campaign_utm_map` column.

---

## Database Migrations

Migrations run in `server/index.ts` on startup (ALTER TABLE statements). Schema changes in `shared/schema.ts` need `db:push` with `DATABASE_URL` to apply to production DB.

**Known issue:** `campaign_utm_map` column exists in Drizzle schema but may not exist in the actual DB if migrations haven't run. Disconnect endpoints handle this gracefully with try-catch.

---

## Pre-existing TS Errors

`storage.ts` has many pre-existing TypeScript errors (KPIReport, attributionModels, etc.) that are NOT caused by recent changes. These don't block the build because `esbuild` is used for the server, not `tsc`.

## UI Libraries & Conventions

- **Icons:** Lucide React (e.g., `Trash2` for delete, `Plus` for add, `Pencil`/`Edit` for edit)
- **Dialogs:** Radix UI AlertDialog for destructive confirmations (NOT native `window.confirm()`)
- **Toasts:** `useToast()` hook from `@/hooks/use-toast`
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with dark mode support (`dark:` variants)
- **Charts:** Recharts (LineChart, BarChart, PieChart)
- **Date formatting:** `date-fns`
